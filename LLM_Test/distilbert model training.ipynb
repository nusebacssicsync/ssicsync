The cost of inventories may not be recoverable in full if any inventories are damaged, or if they become obsolete, or if their selling prices have declined. The estimate of allowance for inventories is based on the age of these inventories, prevailing market conditions of the luxury timepieces and related products in the retail industry and historical allowance experience which require management s judgement. Management applies judgement in determining the appropriate allowance for inventories based upon a detailed technical assessment of inventories concerned including considering the future demand and future selling prices for the products and ageing analysis of inventories. This methodology relies upon assumptions made in determining the appropriate allowance percentages for each category of inventories.   \n",

       "42  principal activities of the Company consist of trading in chemicals and chemical-related products and investment holding. It is listed on Catalist which is a share market on Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are described in Note 13 below. The registered offi ce is: 11 Tuas Link 1, Singapore 638588. The Company is situated in Singapore. Uncertainties relating to the current economic conditions Management has considered the current economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, commodities infl ation, as well as the war in Ukraine at the end of the reporting year and reviewed the probable impact and plausible downside scenarios. No material uncertainties were identifi ed in connection with the reporting entity s ability to continue in operational existence for the near future. Statement of compliance with fi nancial reporting standards These fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ( SFRS(I) ) and the related Interpretations to SFRS(I) ( SFRS(I) INT ) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. They are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 and with the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRSs ) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ). Accounting convention The fi nancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where a fi nancial reporting standard requires an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these fi nancial statements. The accounting policies in the fi nancial reporting standards may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by fi nancial reporting standards may not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material. Basis of preparation of the fi nancial statements The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the fi nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity s accounting policies. The areas requiring management s most diffi cult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signifi cant to the fi nancial statements, are disclosed at the end of this footnote, where applicable.   \n",
