Significant accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The significant accounting estimates and assumptions used and areas involving a high degree of judgement are described below. 114 ANNUAL REPORT 2023   \n",

The registered offi ce is: 11 Tuas Link 1, Singapore 638588. The Company is situated in Singapore. Uncertainties relating to the current economic conditions Management has considered the current economic conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, commodities infl ation, as well as the war in Ukraine at the end of the reporting year and reviewed the probable impact and plausible downside scenarios. No material uncertainties were identifi ed in connection with the reporting entity s ability to continue in operational existence for the near future. Statement of compliance with fi nancial reporting standards These fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ( SFRS(I) ) and the related Interpretations to SFRS(I) ( SFRS(I) INT ) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. They are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 and with the International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRSs ) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ). Accounting convention The fi nancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where a fi nancial reporting standard requires an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these fi nancial statements. The accounting policies in the fi nancial reporting standards may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by fi nancial reporting standards may not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity s accounting policies. The areas requiring management s most diffi cult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signifi cant to the fi nancial statements, are disclosed at the end of this footnote, where applicable.   \n",
